# VisualCeption
Visual regression tests integrated in Codeception.

## Requirements

VisualCeption needs the following components to run:

* *Codeception* VisualCeption is a module for Codeception. It will need a running version of this tool.
* *Imagick* For comparing two images VisualCeption is using the imagick library for php.
* *WebDriver module* This tool does only work with webdriver at the moment.

## Installation

## Usage

## Restriction

VisualCeption uses the WebDriver module for making the screenshots. As a consequence we are not able to take screenshots via google chrome as the crhomedriver does not allow full page screenshots.
